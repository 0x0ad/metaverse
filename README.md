## What is it?

The Metaverse is the next and most likely final generation of the internet. In the Metaverse users can interact with each other and a computer generated environment in a virtual-reality setting. This project aims to act as a guideline on what is possible in such universe.

The main rules of the Metaverse:
- Decentralized (thus no one owns it)
- Cross-platform (you do not need virtual reality equipment to interact with it)
- Unobservable from the outside world
- Ever-expanding

## Our approach

### The first version of this project aims to fulfill all the rules given above.

* The Metaverse is built from **chunks**, which are stored in a block-chain. Each block should contain a part of the Metaverse.

* Each chunk is generated by [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin noise).

* Chunks are ordered in a **spiral**.

* These chunks will server as the base for the Metaverse.

* The only thing left is to let users interact with each other and the world.
